<!-- Overall note _ I took an intro to web dev summer course with Hackeryou in 2019 (now Juno)
and while we weren't graded, it's why I knew to look for resources like containers and flexbox when it comes to handling images.
I wish some more of the theory had stuck from that time, but as I got going it became clear that some of the practice had been retained in that I knew how to look for resources and terms that would get me to where I needed to go even if I couldn't always fully nail the implementation. It was interesting to see what came back to me and what didn't as I worked through what I had. -->
