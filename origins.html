        <p> Deep in the lush vistas surrounding a 16 lane expressway, the recent demolition of a commercial "park" unleashed nature's hot pockets for small predators- rats. On a walk one night, I thought I saw an unleashed dog trotting down a condo sidewalk. Or was it a common housecat? It was neither. Before you could say 'I need multiple photos', she was gone. Luckily she returned a few days later for more delicious rats and several panicked photos of marginal quality. Let's say they're from security footage.
